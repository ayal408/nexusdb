"""Unit tests for the metrics/tracing context managers.

These use OpenTelemetry's default no-op providers (no collector/exporter is
configured in tests), so they verify the *control flow* — the wrapped
operation still runs, its return value/exception still propagates, spans and
metrics are recorded without raising — rather than actual exported data.
